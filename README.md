## Context

This research will investigate the effects of performing full body workouts on sleep patterns, particularly Awakenings, light sleep, deep sleep, and the Sleep score, using a Smart watch. The study will be conducted over a period of 30 days, during which the participant will perform a full body workout on alternating days and rest on the other days. The full body workout is expected to take ≈50 minutes to complete. The participant will be instructed to maintain a consistent sleep schedule of ≈420 minutes per night throughout the study period, and the data collected from the Smart watch will be used to examine any changes in sleep patterns based on the participant's daily exercise schedule.
