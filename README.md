## Context

This research will investigate the effects of performing full body workouts on sleep patterns, particularly Rapid Eye Movement (REM sleep), light sleep, and deep sleep, using a Smart watch. The study will be conducted over a period of 30 days, during which the participant will alternate between full body workouts and rest days on a daily basis. The participant will be instructed to maintain a consistent sleep schedule of 7 hours per night throughout the study period, and the data collected from the Smart watch will be used to examine any changes in sleep patterns based on the participant's daily exercise schedule.
