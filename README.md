**Note:** 
I manually gathered the data as the participant for this research, which examined the effects of performing full body workouts on sleep patterns using a smartwatch over a 30-day period.

## Context

This research will investigate the effects of performing full body workouts on sleep patterns, particularly Awakenings, light sleep, deep sleep, and the Sleep score, using a Smart watch. The study will be conducted over a period of 30 days, during which the participant will perform a full body workout on alternating days and rest on the other days. The full body workout is expected to take ≈50 minutes to complete. The participant will be instructed to maintain a consistent sleep schedule of ≈420 minutes per night throughout the study period, and the data collected from the Smart watch will be used to examine any changes in sleep patterns based on the participant's daily exercise schedule.

## Columns

Date: The specific date when the data was recorded

Workout: Indicates whether the individual workout out on a specific day or not.

Workout duration: The duration of the subject's full body workout each day during the study period.

Workout type: The type of workout performed, such as upper body, lower body, or full body.

Sleep duration: The total amount of time slept, measured in minutes.

Awakenings: Duration of awakenings during sleepm measured in minutes

Deep sleep: The duration of deep sleep, measured in minutes.

Light sleep: The duration of light sleep, measured in minutes.

Score: The overall quality of a person's sleep.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the findings of this research study suggest that incorporating full body workouts into a regular exercise routine can have positive effects on sleep patterns and sleep quality. The study revealed a significant reduction in the duration of awakenings, indicating improved sleep continuity and fewer disruptions during the night. Furthermore, there was an observed inverse relationship between light sleep and deep sleep, with a decrease in light sleep duration and an increase in deep sleep duration. This shift in sleep stages suggests enhanced sleep architecture and potentially more restorative sleep. Additionally, although there was an initial decrease in the sleep score during the first week, it gradually increased over time, indicating an overall improvement in sleep quality as participants continued with the full body workout regimen.

These findings highlight the potential benefits of regular physical activity, specifically full body workouts, in promoting better sleep health. Improved sleep quality has wide-ranging implications for physical and cognitive well-being, including enhanced physical recovery, improved cognitive function, and better mood regulation. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and optimize exercise parameters for optimal sleep benefits. Nonetheless, these findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between exercise and sleep and emphasize the importance of incorporating regular physical activity for a good night’s sleep.
